You have the option to create templates with just dir structures, just empty files or even include the content of a few files. You can then use your templates to recreate those directories and files anywhere else!

Remember that there are no limits to what can be part of a template. Use the include and exclude patterns to fully customize what goes into your templates!`,

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
